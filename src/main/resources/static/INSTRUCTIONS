If you want to use the ATG Simulator provided, in order to check the "Get sensor reading" button, please follow the next steps:
- Install Virtual Serial Port Driver.
    This software will create pairs of COM ports that will allow you to get sensor readings.
    After installation, run the app and select the "Manage Ports tab".
    Select "First port" and "Second port" and click Add Pair. This will create a pair of virtual ports in which First port
    is connected to the ATG (sensor simulation) app and Second port is connected to the LevelMonitor app.
- Run ATGSim.exe
    This will allow you to simulate levels of Diesel and Water, which will be transmitted to the LevelMonitor app.
    Make sure you have the message COMx: Opened in the bottom left corner. This indicates that the COM pair is OK.
    Use the up and down buttons to increase and decrease the levels.
- Modify the COM port in the SensorController class (line 31), by adding the "Second Port" value from the Virtual Serial Port Driver app.
- Run the LevelMonitor app.
